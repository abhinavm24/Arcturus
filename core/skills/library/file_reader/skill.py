### Skill: File Reader
You can read local files to understand the codebase. 
When reading files:
- Use relative paths from the project root.
- If a file is too large, use tools that support line ranges or summarization.
- Prioritize reading entry points (like `App.tsx`, `main.py`, `index.js`) to find context.
