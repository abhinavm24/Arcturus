# Arcturus

Arcturus is a local-first AI workspace that brings agents, memory, documents, voice, structured workflows, and app-building into one desktop product.

It is designed for people who want more than a chat window. You can explore files, run agent workflows, build artifacts, inspect memory, browse knowledge graphs, manage skills, and operate the system from a single interface.

## Why Arcturus

We built Arcturus to help teams and students move beyond isolated AI demos and into real end-to-end application building.

That means one product where you can:

- work with agents, not just prompts
- connect memory, retrieval, workflows, and UI in the same system
- generate artifacts, apps, and reports instead of only chat responses
- inspect how the system runs through traces, health, and execution views
- operate AI features like a product team, with testing, controls, and reusable skills

## App Guide

| Area | What it does | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Echo | voice assistant for questions, commands, dictation, and spoken workflows | makes the system hands-free and accessible in real time |
| Runs | execution graph for agent tasks, intermediate outputs, and orchestration state | makes agent behavior inspectable instead of opaque |
| Forge | structured document and slide generation with preview and export flows | turns prompts into usable deliverables |
| Apps | internal app and dashboard generation inside the platform | helps users build actual tools, not just responses |
| IDE | editor, terminal, file navigation, and code-aware IDE Agent | supports end-to-end coding and implementation work |
| RAG | indexed retrieval over notes, PDFs, and project content | grounds answers in source material |
| RemMe | persistent memory, recall, and profile context | improves continuity across sessions and workflows |
| Graph | visual explorer for extracted entities and relationships | turns memory and content into navigable structure |
| Scheduler | recurring jobs, automation runs, and execution history | makes the platform useful beyond one-off interaction |
| Watchtower | diagnostics, tracing, health, and runtime controls | provides production-style observability and governance |
| Skills / Bazaar | installable capabilities and reusable packaged logic | supports extensibility and distribution |

### Product Overview

Arcturus ships as a unified workspace rather than a collection of disconnected tools. The About screen gives a quick map of the major product surfaces available inside the platform.

### Apps

Apps turns Arcturus into an application builder, not just an assistant. The platform can generate and host internal dashboards, workflows, and interactive tools directly inside the product.

![Apps builder output](docs/Apps.png)

### Forge

Forge is the structured artifact studio. It can generate decks and documents from prompts, preserve outlines, and let you inspect and refine the generated output before export.

### Runs

Runs shows the live structure of agent execution. You can inspect orchestration graphs, active tasks, intermediate outputs, and the data each step is producing.

### IDE

The IDE workspace combines a code editor, terminal, file navigation, and an IDE Agent that can inspect code, call tools, and help execute coding workflows end to end.

### Echo

Echo is the voice-native interface for Arcturus. It supports hands-free interaction for asking questions, navigating the product, triggering agent workflows, and dictating notes.

### Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph helps users explore relationships extracted from memory and content. It turns entity extraction into a navigable visual layer for discovery and analysis.

### Scheduler

The scheduler automates recurring jobs and makes Arcturus useful beyond one-off chats. It supports repeatable agent tasks, result history, and operational visibility.

## What Arcturus Does

Arcturus combines multiple AI product surfaces into one system:

- `IDE Agent`: read files, reason over code, call tools, and help with edits
- `Forge`: generate structured documents, slide decks, and exportable artifacts
- `RemMe`: persistent memory, entity extraction, contextual recall, and sync
- `RAG`: search and chat over PDFs, notes, and indexed content
- `Voice`: wake, transcribe, route, and respond through the voice pipeline
- `Apps`: create interactive internal tools and dashboards inside the platform
- `Watchtower`: health checks, tracing, throttling, diagnostics, and admin visibility
- `Skills / Bazaar`: installable capabilities, SDK flows, integrity checks, and marketplace-style packaging
- `Runs / Swarm`: inspect agent execution, orchestration state, and multi-agent flows

## Core Experience

Arcturus is built around a few connected workflows:

1. Bring in context
   - notes, PDFs, pages, files, memory, and external sources
2. Run an agent
   - ask for reasoning, editing, extraction, planning, or execution
3. Materialize output
   - pages, slides, graphs, dashboards, summaries, or app artifacts
4. Observe and refine
   - inspect traces, health, cost controls, memory, and rerun behavior

## Architecture

| Layer | Stack | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop UI | Electron + React + Vite + Zustand | main product interface |
| Backend API | FastAPI + Python | orchestration, routing, settings, persistence, services |
| Memory | local stores + sync + graph adapters | recall, extraction, lifecycle, visibility |
| Retrieval | RAG pipelines + vector backends | search over documents and content |
| Voice | STT + TTS + wake services | spoken interaction and command flows |
| Ops | Watchtower, tracing, diagnostics, health | production visibility and governance |
| SDK / Marketplace | Bazaar SDK and skill packaging | installable capabilities and distribution |

## Main Product Areas

| Area | What you can do |
| --- | --- |
| Explorer | browse project files and work with an IDE-style agent |
| Notes / Pages | create and view structured long-form content |
| Forge | generate slides, outlines, artifacts, and previews |
| Graph | inspect entities and relationships |
| Apps | build internal tools, dashboards, and UI surfaces |
| News / Browser | consume live content in-app |
| Settings / Admin | configure models, services, health, and runtime controls |
| Runs | inspect agent execution and flow state |
| RAG | search, ask, and browse indexed documents |

## Quick Start

### 1. Backend prerequisites

Arcturus expects Python `3.11` and uses `uv` for environment management.

```bash
uv sync --python 3.11
```

If you want the standard local data services used by the app:

```bash
docker compose up -d mongodb qdrant
```

### 2. Frontend prerequisites

```bash
cd /Users/rohanshravan/TSAI/Arcturus/platform-frontend
npm ci
```

### 3. Run the desktop app

From `/Users/rohanshravan/TSAI/Arcturus/platform-frontend`:

```bash
npm run electron:dev:all
```

This launches:

- the Electron shell
- the Vite frontend
- the local backend services the desktop app depends on

## Alternative Dev Commands

### Backend only

```bash
cd /Users/rohanshravan/TSAI/Arcturus
uv run api.py
```

### Frontend only

```bash
cd /Users/rohanshravan/TSAI/Arcturus/platform-frontend
npm run dev
```

### Frontend + backend without Electron packaging flow

```bash
cd /Users/rohanshravan/TSAI/Arcturus/platform-frontend
npm run dev:all
```

## How To Use Arcturus

### Explore and edit with the IDE Agent

- open the Explorer
- choose a project or file context
- ask the IDE Agent to inspect, explain, or modify code
- review tool calls and outputs in the conversation flow

### Build documents and presentations

- open Forge
- generate an outline, page, or deck
- preview the artifact
- export to the supported output format

### Use memory and knowledge graph features

- create or inspect memories in RemMe
- view extracted entities and relationships
- use memory-aware flows to improve continuity across sessions

### Search documents with RAG

- upload or select documents
- query the indexed content
- inspect source-backed answers and related artifacts

### Operate the system

- open admin and settings panels
- inspect health and diagnostics
- monitor runs, traces, and agent execution state

scripts/test_all.sh quick
```

Frontend tests:

cd /Users/rohanshravan/TSAI/Arcturus/platform-frontend
npm test
```

## Configuration

- runtime settings live in `/Users/rohanshravan/TSAI/Arcturus/config/settings.json`
- defaults live in `/Users/rohanshravan/TSAI/Arcturus/config/settings.defaults.json`
- secrets should stay in local environment variables or `.env`, not in Git

## Security Notes

- `.env` is intentionally untracked
- use `.env.example` as the template for local secrets
- do not commit API keys, tokens, voice logs, transcripts, or personal runtime data
- admin and webhook paths fail closed when required secrets are not configured
